# VirtualCursor

VirtualCursor is a Python project that allows users to control their computer cursor using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures in real-time using a webcam and translates these gestures into cursor movements.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection**: Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures.
- **Cursor Control**: Translates detected gestures into cursor movements.
- **Click Buttons**: Allows users to left-click, right-click, double-left-click and scroll using hand gestures.
